                                        one to build a component that performs a task by training a model from data,
                                        which removes the need for a human to specify exactly how to perform the task.</p>

                                            Better metrics: As we deploy well trained and tested Models ,performance  metrics such as precision and recall  are higher.

                                        <li>
                                            Simplicity: As we deploy the End-to-end models ,problems of determining individual components and tasks needed to perform are not needed.
