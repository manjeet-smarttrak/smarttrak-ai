                                    <p><b>Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging field in machine learning</b> that aims to address how black box
                                        decisions of AI systems are made. This area inspects and tries to understand the steps and models
                                        involved in making decisions. XAI is thus expected by most of the owners, operators and users to
                                        answer some hot questions like: Why did the AI system make a specific prediction or decision? Why
                                        didnâ€™t the AI system do something else? When did the AI system succeed and when did it fail?
                                        When do AI systems give enough confidence in the decision that you can trust it, and how can the
                                        AI system correct errors that arise?</p>

                                    <p>The Explainable AI (XAI) aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Produce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction accuracy).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners.
                                        </li>
