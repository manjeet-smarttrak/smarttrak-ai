                                    <p>AI relies heavily on data transmission and computation of complex machine learning algorithms.
                                        Edge computing sets up a new age computing paradigm that moves AI and machine learning to where the
                                        data generation and computation actually take place: the network’s edge. The amalgamation of
                                        both edge computing and AI gave birth to a new frontier: Edge AI.</p>

                                    <p>Edge AI allows faster computing and insights, better data security, and efficient control over continuous
                                        operation. As a result, it can enhance the performance of AI-enabled applications and keep the
                                        operating costs down. Edge AI can also assist AI in overcoming the technological challenges
                                        associated with it.</p>

                                    <p>Edge AI facilitates machine learning, autonomous application of deep learning models, and advanced
                                        algorithms on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices itself, away from cloud services.</p>

                                    <p>An efficient Edge AI model has an optimized infrastructure for edge computing that can handle bulkier
                                        AI workloads on the edge and near the edge. Edge AI paired with storage solutions can provide
                                        industry-leading performance and limitless scalability that enables businesses to use their data
                                        efficiently.</p>

                                    <p>Many global businesses are already reaping the benefits of Edge AI. From improving production monitoring
                                        of an assembly line to driving autonomous vehicles, Edge AI can benefit various industries.
                                        Moreover, the recent rolling out of 5G technology in many countries gives an extra boost for
                                        Edge AI as more industrial applications for the technology continue to emerge.</p>

                                            Machine learning is the artificial simulation of the human learning process with the use of data and algorithms. Machine learning with the aid of Edge AI can lend a helping hand, particularly to businesses that rely heavily on IoT devices.

                                                    <b>Privacy:</b> Today, information and data being the most valuable assets, consumers are cautious of the location of their data. The companies that can deliver AI-enabled personalized features in their applications can make their users understand how their data is being collected and stored. It enhances the brand loyalty of the customers.

                                                    <b>Minimal Bandwidth:</b> Every single day, an enterprise with thousands of IoT devices has to transmit huge amounts of data to the cloud. Then carry out the analytics in the cloud, and retransmit the analytics results back to the device. Without a wider network bandwidth and cloud storage, this complex process would turn it into an impossible task. Not to mention the possibility of exposing sensitive information during the process.
                                                    However, Edge AI implements cloudlet technology, which is small-scale cloud storage located at the network’s edge. Cloudlet technology enhances mobility and reduces the load of data transmission. Consequently, it can bring down the cost of data services and enhance data flow speed and reliability.

Sixty percent of organizations surveyed in a recent study conducted by RightScale agree that the holy grail of cost-saving hides in cloud computing initiatives. Edge AI, in contrast, eliminates the exorbitant expenses incurred on the AI or machine learning processes carried out on cloud-based data centers.
